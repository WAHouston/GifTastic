# GifTastic
### This is a gif search app
#### Usage
* Users enter a topic into the input bar and click the submit button. 
* This creates a button with that word on it.
* The user then clicks on the button with their search term on it.
* When the user clicks that button, ten gifs related to that term appear.
* The user then clicks a gif to animate it and clicks it again to pause it.
#### Purpose
* The gif search app demonstrates an ability to use ajax to pull data from an api and then display and manipulate that data.
